## Hi there 👋

## About me

I am Mathieu, a full stack developer with a focus on frontend. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on 2 projects:
    - Drag and Drop tutorials (two with different libraries and one in plain CSS)
    - an mapping project whose main feature is to animate people's location through years.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about draggable and dropable components, as well as maps and automated video creation.-
